# Golang skills

This project was created by me as a way to demonstrate my Golang skills.
Obviously, it's a simple project, only for demo purposes. I can do more than that :)

This project is an Async worker. It's get messages from AWS Sqs, do a http GET request in a http endpoint, and saves the result on dynamodb.
It's not a real world project, it's just to demo, as I said before.

All the commands to run the project is in Makefile.
